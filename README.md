# Allan Rehhoff's Framework #

This is not what you'd typically associate witha  fully functional MVC framework, and that is 
intentional.
All this does is serve as a kickstart to get a good and readable codebase when starting up a new 
custom web project.

To avoid this from being bloated it has been stripped for all things such as libraries, external 
classes, modules.
