# Custom PHP Framework - Introduction (Version 9)
A no-nonsense, lightweight, custom framework using intuitive patterns and requiring almost no boilerplate code.  
Say goodbye to manually defining routes and unnecessary bloatware. 

Designed for developers who want to get moving quickly, this framework keeps things simple and efficient.  
While jQuery is included for convenience, it's not mandatory and can be easily removed if you prefer native JavaScript.

Kickstart your new web project or API with a clean, stable codebase.
